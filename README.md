# Data-Science-Projects
It is going to be my main repository to hold the kaggle challenges, any less important data science project or any notebook I find valuable.

# List of projects:
- [x] [Heart Failure - NEW](https://github.com/Carmui/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Kaggle_Heart_Failure/Heart_Failure.ipynb) 
**Description**:   In this project I decided to use 4 models and then I made a comparison of them. Mostly, I was checking the accuracy of models in many ways and I was learning how to detect overfitting. There were some problems with the data but I couldn't get around the problem with overfitting. I have decided not to fix the imbalance of the class since I am still learning how to do it. (I am going to show my skills of dealing with this problem in next project)  If you want to check more [click here](https://github.com/Carmui/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Kaggle_Heart_Failure/).
**Algorithms used**: Logistic Regression, SVC, KNN, Random Forest
#
- [x] [Torusim attractiveness ranking of Polish voivodships](https://github.com/Carmui/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Tourism_ranking_Poland/Ranking_województw_turystyka.ipynb) 
**Description**:   Well, it isn't really machine learning project but I decided to put it there since I learned a lot during doing this notebook. It shows my skills to do multivariate comparative analysis. Project is all about creating a ranking of Polish voivodships in the topic mentioned above.

**Algorithms used**: Synthetic Measure of Development, BZW
#
- [x] [Home Credit default risk](https://github.com/Carmui/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Kaggle_Home_Credit/Home_Credit_Kaggle.ipynb)
**Description**: One of the kaggle challenges - the main goal was to learn how to deal up with   
dichotomous variable. What is more, the project includes a bit of exploratory data analysis with wide range of plots. If you want to check more [click here](https://github.com/Carmui/Data-Science-Projects/tree/master/Kaggle_Home_Credit).
**Algorithms used**: Logistic Regression, GridSearchCV
#
- [x] [Pokemon](https://github.com/Carmui/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Kaggle_Pokemon/Pokemon.ipynb) 
**Description**: I have always been keen on pokemon series. As a big fan I couldn't just leave this project without any own contribution. It is one of my first projects so I decided to learn how to analyze data before I dip into the harder part of Data Science.

**Algorithms used**: EDA, plotting
#

- [x] [Iris species](https://github.com/Carmui/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Kaggle_Iris_Species/Iris_species_Kaggle.ipynb)
**Description**: Another one of the kaggle challenges - it isn't really one of my best projects since it was used as a preparation to use KNN algorithm. It contains some kind of the plotting, KNN method  and one harder visualisation of the groups.

**Algorithms used**: k-Nearest Neighbors, plotting, EDA
