<p align="center"><h1>Pokemon - Weedle's Cave</h1></p>

***This is my first kaggle kernel and I decided to write it for a Pokemon dataset. At this very moment I am going to do an overview of the pokemons and show my actual skills that I have recently acquired. I am not going to predict the results of pokemon battles but it might happen in the future.***

***

>Welcome to Weedle's cave. Will you be able to predict the outcome of future matches?

>To do it you will have the pokemon characteristics and the results of previous combats.

>Three files are available. The first one contains the Pokemon characteristics (the first column being the id of the Pokemon). The second one contains information about previous combats. The first two columns contain the ids of the combatants and the third one the id of the winner. Important: The Pokemon in the first columns attacks first.

>The goal is to develop a Machine Learning model able to predict the result of future pokemon combats.

>##### DISCLAIMER
>The Pokemon characteristics come from the actual game but the battle data has been generated by a custom algorithm that doesn't take into account some of the game characteristics to simplify the dataset.
